    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A homemade orange chicken recipe that mimics the Chinese takeout recipe. Requires at least 30 minutes of time to marinate.</p>
    <ul> Ingredients
        <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless, chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
        <li>1 cup 2 tablespoons cornstarch, divided</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 green onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <p>For the marinage:</p>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon orange zest</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha, or more, to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon white pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the marinade, whisk together chicken broth, orange juice, sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, orange zest, Sriracha, ginger and white pepper in a large bowl. In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, combine chicken and 2/3 cup of the marinade; marinate for at least 30 minutes, turning the bag occasionally. Drain the chicken from the marinade, discarding the marinade.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining marinade in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil and stir in 2 tablespoons cornstarch combined with 2 tablespoons water. Cook, stirring frequently, until thickened about 1-2 minutes; keep warm.</li>
        <li>Working one at a time, dip the chicken into the eggs, then dredge in remaining 1 cup cornstarch, pressing to coat.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan. Working in batches, add chicken and fry until golden brown and cooked through, about 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; discard excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve chicken immediately, tossed or drizzled with the marinade, garnished with sesame seeds and green onion, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
